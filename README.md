# DDDGenerator
## Database Design Document Generator

Generates a DDD document for mysql database.

There are already some tools that do this, but those that seems to be the best ones are paid solutions. Furthermore, the results use to be in a *not friendly format*, and I mean friendly as something wide system compatilhe and portable. That is, the current tools are reasonably capable to document the database, but the final output format are viewable only to the software that generated the document.
